# 🩺 AI Doctor Voice Bot (Vision + Speech)

An **AI-powered Doctor Assistant** that can:
- 🎙️ Listen to patient voice (Speech-to-Text)
- 🖼️ Analyze medical images (Vision LLM)
- 🧠 Generate doctor-like responses
- 🔊 Speak back with realistic voice (Text-to-Speech)
- 🌐 Run in a clean **Gradio Web UI**

## 🚀 Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** using Groq Whisper (`whisper-large-v3`)
- **Vision-based medical reasoning** using LLaMA 4 Vision models via Groq
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** using ElevenLabs (realistic voices)
- **Cross-platform audio playback** (Windows / macOS / Linux)
- **Interactive Gradio UI**
- Modular and clean codebase

## 🧠 How the System Works

1 Voice Input (Patient)
- The user speaks symptoms through a microphone.

2 Speech-to-Text (STT)
- The audio is converted into text using the Whisper large model via Groq.

3 Medical Image Input
- The user uploads a medical image such as a skin condition or injury photo.

4 Vision-Based Analysis
- A vision-enabled LLaMA model analyzes the image along with the transcribed symptoms.

5 Doctor-Style Response Generation
- A carefully engineered system prompt ensures the response sounds professional, concise, and human-like.

6 Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- The final response is converted into realistic speech using ElevenLabs.

7 User Output
- The user receives:
  - Transcribed speech
  - Doctor’s textual response
  - Spoken audio response

## 📦 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chintan1545/AI-Doctor-Voice-Bot.git
cd AI-Doctor-Voice-Bot
```
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linu
```
3️⃣ Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ System Dependencies (IMPORTANT)

🔹 FFmpeg (Required for audio playback)
Check:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
Install:

- Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (add to PATH)
- macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
- Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

---

🔹 PyAudio (Microphone Support)
Windows (Recommended)
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```
macOS
```bash
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```
Linux
```bash
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Open in browser:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 🎤 User speaks → Whisper STT converts speech to text
2. 🖼️ User uploads image → Vision LLM analyzes medical context
3. 🧠 AI generates a doctor-style response
4. 🔊 ElevenLabs converts text → natural speech
5. 🌐 Gradio displays text + plays audio
